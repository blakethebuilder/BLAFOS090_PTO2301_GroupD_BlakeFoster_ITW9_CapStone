            During my time at Code Space, I embarked on an enriching learning
            journey that equipped me with a foundational understanding of web
            development. The Intro to Web course provided me with a
            comprehensive overview of the web development landscape, from basic
            HTML and CSS syntax to advanced concepts such as responsive design
            and web accessibility. Through a mix of theoretical learning and
            hands-on practice, I gained the practical skills and knowledge
            needed to design and develop engaging web pages and sites. The
            course was led by experienced instructors who provided invaluable
            guidance and feedback throughout the learning process, fostering an
            environment of collaboration and growth. As a result, I emerged from
